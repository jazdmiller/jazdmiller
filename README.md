## My Background 🎨

My journey into the world of coding began with an Etsy shop I managed in 2020. It was when I wanted to create a website for my shop that I fell in love with the intricacies of code and design, learning how to create websites and personalize themes on platforms like Shopify and Wordpress.

Fast-forward to the summer of 2022 when I further sharpened my coding skills by completing the 6-month software engineering bootcamp at General Assembly. This intensive training provided me with a strong foundation in coding and development through 450+ hours of hands-on experience. Following the bootcamp, I did a 6-month UX internship at a software company, where I had the incredible opportunity to work alongside talented developers. Together, we designed and developed interfaces for custom web portals, enhancing my understanding of user-centric design and front-end development. 

This unique blend of experiences has shaped me into a versatile and dedicated developer and I am passionate about using my skills to create engaging and effective digital solutions. Feel free to reach out and let's build something great together! 🚀
