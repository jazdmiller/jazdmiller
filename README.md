## Hi there! üëãüèΩ My name is Jazmine Miller

### My Focus 

My focus revolves around frontend development and design, where I primarily work with React, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and other frontend frameworks/libraries to craft visually stunning and interactive experiences. I'm passionate about creating a sense of seamlessness and ease in my work, ensuring that every interaction feels natural and engaging.
