## Hi there! 👋🏽 My name is Jazmine Miller

### My Focus 🔭

My focus revolves around frontend development and design, where I primarily work with React, Bootstrap, Material UI, and other frontend frameworks/libraries to craft visually stunning and interactive experiences. I'm passionate about creating a sense of seamlessness and ease in my projects, ensuring that every interaction feels natural and engaging.
