## Hi there! 👋🏽 My name is Jazmine Miller

### My Focus 🔭

My focus revolves around frontend development and design, where I primarily work with React, CSS, Bootstrap, Material UI, and other frontend frameworks/libraries to craft visually stunning and interactive experiences. I'm passionate about creating a sense of seamlessness and ease in my projects, ensuring that every interaction feels natural and engaging.
### My Background 🎨

My journey into the world of coding began with an Etsy shop I managed in 2020. It was when I learned to create a website for my shop that I fell in love with the intricacies of code and design, which lead to me completing a 6-month software engineering bootcamp at General Assembly in 2022. This intensive training provided me with a strong foundation in coding and development through hands-on experience. Following the bootcamp, I did a 6-month UX internship at a software company, where I had the incredible opportunity to work alongside talented developers. Together, we designed and developed interfaces for custom web portals, enhancing my understanding of user-centric design and front-end development.
